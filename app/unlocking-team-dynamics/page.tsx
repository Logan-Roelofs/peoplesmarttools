        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Mismanagement can significantly impact personal productivity. When employees feel mismanaged, they become disengaged, contributing very little to their assignments’ success. In many work environments, a significant portion of human capital is spent on relationship issues, diverting focus from excelling at work.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Disengaged employees can negatively affect other employees and customers. According to recent Gallup studies, employee disengagement costs U.S. employers a staggering $300 billion annually. Properly managed or engaged employees usually take fewer sick days and generate an average of 43% more revenue.

          Unleashing your team’s true potential starts with understanding what energizes and motivates each member. Our Unlocking Team Dynamics training helps you build trust, rapport, and a culture of collaboration.

            “I just wanted to drop you this note regarding the Communication Skills Workshop that you did for McCulloch County. We continue to see great results from the program! Immediately after the workshop, we experienced a decrease in workplace tension between employees and between elected officials and staff. Productivity skyrocketed! All of us learned to be more accepting of others’ communication styles and to use our own styles to the best advantage in the organization. Months after the program, we are still reaping the benefits.
          </p>
          <p className="italic text-gray-600 mb-2">
            Jim, I wish every organization, family, church, or team could be exposed to this training. I will certainly recommend you at every opportunity. Thanks for the great job and, more importantly, the great results.”
