          Imagine it’s report card time – what grade would you receive on your interpersonal skills? For a team leader, strong interpersonal skills are crucial. The better your communication skills, the more likely you are to be respected and trusted by your team.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
          Effective communication and dealing with people account for a large portion of a manager’s daily work. The way managers and employees communicate significantly affects morale, teamwork, productivity, and employee retention. Frequent communication breakdowns can lead to disengaged employees.

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
          While organizations often train managers and employees in job-specific duties, they frequently overlook interpersonal skills training. Many managers want to improve communication with their teams but don’t know where to start or how to make their communication truly effective.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
