            <span className="font-semibold">Have you ever been mismanaged?</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Have you been guilty of mismanaging one of your employees? The answer is almost always yes!
          </p>
          <p>
            In dealing with workplace issues, I frequently hear stories like the following. See if you can relate.
          </p>
          <div className="bg-gray-50 rounded p-4 border border-gray-200">
            <p className="font-semibold mb-2">Georgina is extremely frustrated. She feels under­utilized in her capacity as the Executive Vice President of her company. During planning meetings her boss doesn’t seem to value her insights and comments.</p>
            <p>
              Her boss’s highest value is “get things done.” His favorite saying is “Executing successfully is everything!” Georgina muses, “Why doesn’t he believe that I can execute?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “When he hired me, we discussed extensively about my ability to get things done.” “He pays me very well, so I know he doesn’t have gender bias.”
            </p>
            <p>
              She silently screams. “I know I execute successfully, please give me a chance!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Dan, her boss, thinks, “Georgina has potential.” “She is always the first person in the meetings to make suggestions on how to make improvements and changes.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Dan wonders how she can come up with ideas so quickly. As a matter of fact, he suspects her ideas are not quality because she offers them so quickly. He wishes that she would put more thought into her comments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both are frustrated with each other. What can be done to help them resolve their dilemma? The answer is in the next segment.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2 text-gray-800">Comprehending Communication Preferences</h2>
          <p>
            Comprehending how a person likes to interact with his/her environment and their communication preferences is the first step to gaining rapport and trust with an individual.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learning the universal temperament language of DISC will accelerate your influence and skill with people and deepen your understanding of human behavior.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2 text-gray-800">First Take an Inventory</h2>
          <p>
            Both Georgina and Dan responded to a temperament profile analysis that provided an inventory of their communication and relationship preferences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sharing their reports with each other eventually dissolved their angst and ill feelings towards each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dan discovered that Georgina’s natural temperament style is to see the answers to problems and opportunities quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            She likes a medium amount of interaction and has a high need for mobility, both physically and with thought. She is very independent and wants to have some control over the work she does.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dan is dumbfounded! That is exactly what he is looking for in getting the job done.
          </p>
          <p>
            Georgina discovered that Dan has the need to get things done quickly (they are alike in this dimension).
          </p>
          <p>
            He is methodical and accurate. He prefers a small amount of interaction and doesn’t display his emotions. He wants to be accommodating and helpful but will not get too close.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2 text-gray-800">Can They Work Together or Not?</h2>
          <p>
            After much discussion, they decided on a new way to work together.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              Dan will provide Georgina with an agenda prior to each meeting. She agrees to capture her thoughts on paper during the meeting and be more tuned-in to the other members’ comments and suggestions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dan will meet with her the next day and listen to her ideas for improving the company. They agreed to try the system for a month.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dan eventually implements many of her ideas because they were right on target and exactly what he was looking for.
            </li>
            <li>
              From the information she learned in the temperament profile, Georgina made it a habit to not be demanding and give Dan plenty of time to digest, focus, and execute.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Because of their newfound affinity for working together, they can meet and exceed expectations of the quote “Executing is everything!”
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2 text-gray-800">In the End…</h2>
          <p>
            Dan is happy, and Georgina feels valued. What once was a dysfunctional team, is now a dynamic duo experiencing the gifts of understanding, camaraderie and work fulfillment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Does the use of temperament profile assessments always work out this good? The answer is YES! Sometimes a person simply doesn’t have the right temperament or values for a specific job. They discover another job that fits them better and thrive there.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve noticed that people that leave a job usually find a better one. It’s a win-win situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            What would have happened if Georgina and Dan had not experienced the temperament profile process?
          </p>
          <p>
            Both would be investing a lot of time in dealing with their misunderstandings of each other, which robs productivity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dan would be pondering about how to replace Georgina. Georgina would be thinking about finding employment elsewhere even though she was a good fit for her position in the company.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2 text-gray-800">Time Wasted</h2>
          <p>
            In many work environments, much of the employees’ human capital is spent on relationship issues, diverting their focus from excelling at work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stop guessing at how to work best with other people. Be wise, use assessments and get the most out of your employees!
          </p>
          <p>
            Understand their communication and relationship preferences and find a way to work with those preferences. You will be amazed at the transformation right before your eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            What you once thought was inadequate in the employee, you now find to be very much what the job needed. The only thing that changed was a new paradigm of thought.
