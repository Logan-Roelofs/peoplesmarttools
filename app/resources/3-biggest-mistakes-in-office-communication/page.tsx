          3 Biggest Mistakes in Office Communication
        </h1>

      {/* Intro */}
      <section className="max-w-3xl mx-auto py-8 px-4 text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed border-b border-gray-200">
        <p className="mb-4">
          In the bustling corridors of office life, communication isn’t just a bridge—it’s the very air we breathe. Communication is key in any relationship. But in the workplace, miscommunication can be deadly to a professional relationship — and more so, to an organization overall.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Some of these common communication mistakes can lead to bigger issues if not addressed.

      {/* Mistakes List */}
      <section className="max-w-3xl mx-auto py-8 px-4 border-b border-gray-200">

          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Crooked Communication (positive communication followed by a negative remark):</span>
            <span className="block mt-2">
              This is communication that appears positive on the surface but has a hidden negative message. For example, saying “You’re remarkably skilled for someone your age” might seem like a compliment, but it subtly implies that the person’s age is a limitation. Crooked communications appear like compliments but harbor secret barbs.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Plastic Communication (comments given as a ritual):</span>
            <span className="block mt-2">
              These are compliments wrapped in cellophane—shiny but hollow. They are given without genuine feeling or intention. “Great job!” they say, while yawning internally.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Zero Communication (absence of communication when it is expected):</span>
            <span className="block mt-2">
              This is the absence of any feedback, positive or negative. It can make the recipient feel ignored or invisible, which can be detrimental to their motivation and engagement. Examples: Ignoring a greeting, not responding to messages, avoiding eye contact, withholding information on purpose or by default, overlooking contributions such as saying thank-you, and other instances where communication is expected but not received.

      {/* Anecdote */}
      <section className="max-w-3xl mx-auto py-8 px-4 text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed border-b border-gray-200">
        <p className="mb-4">
          I was a speaker at the Texas Municipal League annual conference speaking on the subject ‘Communication Mishaps’. I was discussing the zero-communication mishap, emphasizing the importance of greeting people in the morning with voice, handwave, or eye contact. A city manager stood up quite indignantly and said, “That is a bunch of bull! When I arrive at work, all I want to do is work”.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I then asked the audience how they would react to his workplace entry. Many shared their thoughts, saying things like:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>“If you don’t acknowledge me, I will do my best to avoid you the rest of the day.”</li>
          <li>“I feel no respect and that gets me off to a bad start.”</li>
          <li>“I will be spending my time planning on making you say something, even if it is negative.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The city manager listened for about 10 minutes to the crowd’s comments and later told me it was a valuable lesson for him.

        <p>
          Are you making any of these communication mishaps? Your key employees are most likely being recruited by other organizations. Give them a lot of reasons to stay where they are.
