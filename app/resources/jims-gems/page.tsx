          <li>The price for success is not negotiable, the price is the price.</li>
          <li>Personal energy management is about avoiding strife, comparison, jealousy and adding unlimited forgiveness and mercy.</li>
          <li>When we habitually blame someone else, we become a victim.</li>
          <li>Over commitment reduces the quality of your life and those around you.</li>
          <li>Failing to keep your promises reduces influence and lessens trust.</li>
          <li>Perfection blocks inspiration.</li>
          <li>Humility is considering other people as more important than yourself.</li>
          <li>Someone else’s drama is not your drama, do not buy into it.</li>
          <li>Careful steady effort with hope wins life’s battles.</li>
          <li>Focusing on today’s tasks without regard for the future increases the value of your day. Be in the present, it’s a present.</li>
          <li>If you tolerate bad behavior without dissent, you are signaling the offense is acceptable.</li>
          <li>Improve your revenue quickly with a customer contact point survey. Maximize all those points in favor of the customer.</li>
          <li>Frame your story before you tell it. Set the scene from the beginning, such as, “In my hometown, when I was 15 . . .”</li>
          <li>Teach your inner coach to be your best advocate.</li>
          <li>Ten business owners unanimously concluded: “Maintaining workplace morale includes reassigning or firing poor performers”.</li>
          <li>Encouragement is the jet fuel that starts a mind shift in others.</li>
          <li>Validate good ideas, question assumptions in yourself and others.</li>
          <li>Your good idea today will be a better idea tomorrow. Override your need to act today and be amazed at your new improved perspective.</li>
          <li>Doubt is your real enemy, replace it with action.</li>
          <li>Your mistakes are not catastrophic; play down the drama, play up the possibility.</li>
          <li>Your health is a privilege, not a right. Be intentional about your health practices.</li>
          <li>Giving people attention plus acknowledging their attributes will greatly improve your influence.</li>
          <li>On-boarding new leaders optimally is about creating synergy and defining expectations.</li>
          <li>Look at organizational development as an ecologist looks at the natural environment. Everything is connected to everything. Make changes after asking, “How will this affect . . .?”</li>
          <li>Criticism is painful to receive; however, ask yourself, “Is there a grain of truth in the assertions?” If so, admit fault and seek a remedy.</li>
          <li>Complaining can become a habit. When someone complains, teach them you will listen to the complaint as long as they bring a potential remedy with it.</li>
          <li>When you need to disagree with a person, disagree with their actions not them. For example, “Jim, your rude behavior to the customer wasn’t like you, what’s going on?”</li>
          <li>Money benefits such as salary, paid time off, health insurance, holidays, and bonuses are all spent off the job; money is not a motivator at work.</li>
          <li>The currency of appreciation and inclusion is what drives morale and production on a day to day basis.</li>
          <li>Perfectionism is about avoiding shame and punishment.</li>
